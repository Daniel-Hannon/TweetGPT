Good riddance Randy Gregory

Jerry and Stephen Jones offering Randy Gregory a 1 year, $3M contract 
--------------------------------------------------
Remember the 2022 offseason when the Chiefs were in big trouble because the Broncos, Chargers and Raiders added defensive stars like Randy Gregory, JC Jackson and Chandler Jones? Welp. Those 3 players are no longer on their rosters. Life comes at you fast in Mahomes’s AFC West.

Last year, Randy Gregory initially agreed to return to the Cowboys on a 5-year, $70 million contract, but eventually changed his mind and joined the Broncos on a similar contract with some modifications in the language.

Now he's out in Denver ... and back available.

Stunning news. Randy Gregory gets cut?!?!?  Wow…. Let me make a couple of calls. Will have a podcast react coming soon!

The Cowboys were saved by Randy Gregory’s dumb ass agent for wanting him out of Dallas. Jerry and Stephen Jones were about to give Randy Gregory the bag before his agent, Peter Schaffer, went stupid. Now Gregory is unemployed. I guess in the end, it worked out for Schaffer.

George Paton should be fired tomorrow. Absolute shocker walking drug suspension/ IR slot Randy Gregory didn’t work out. Just an awful move from the start. Paton ran this franchise further into the ground.

After a week of trying to trade him - the Broncos have cut Randy Gregory, per 
@AdamSchefter
 

Denver gave him a 5-year, $70 million contract last offseason.

Sean Payton has said he will play the best players, regardless of how much money they make or where they were drafted.

By releasing Randy Gregory, he sends his biggest message to the team to date.
--------------------------------------------------
Per source, in light of Randy Gregory having his playing time reduced and not starting he realized it wasn’t a good fit here. New staff likes young talent. He asked for release yesterday. Sean Payton slept on it and decided best for all to let veteran go. #9sports

Broncos’ LB Nik Benitto replaced Randy Gregory as a starter last week vs. Chicago and helped force a game-tying sack-fumble that was returned for a touchdown. More time ahead for Benitto.
